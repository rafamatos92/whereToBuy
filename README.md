# Where to buy

A new Flutter project. This app is designed to help users create a shopping list in a smart and efficient way, while saving money. With the app, users can easily create and manage shopping lists that are automatically organized by supermarkets and sorted by the lowest price of each item.

The app allows users to filter their list by category, making it easier to navigate and find specific items. Users can add and edit items, as well as add and edit supermarkets to fit their specific shopping needs.

By using this app, users can be confident that they are getting the best deal on their shopping, as the app will automatically show the lowest price for each item across all supermarkets.

Overall, the app aims to streamline the shopping process and save users time and money.
